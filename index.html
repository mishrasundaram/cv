My ability to analyse difficult situations and design unique solutions that optimise performance and efficiency demonstrates my love for problem solving. Working with APIs, cloud services, and databases to ensure smooth integration and data management for scalable and future-proof solutions is nothing new to me.
I thrive in collaborative workplaces as a devoted team player, creating excellent working connections with cross-functional teams to meet project objectives. My communication abilities are a benefit in communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, allowing for easy communication throughout the development process.
